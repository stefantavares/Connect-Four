# **CONNECT FOUR**

## **HISTORY**

It was in 1974 when Milton Bradley brought the plastic version of Connect Four to the masses creating a cultural phenomenon. Howard Wexler, a toy inventor, is given credit for creating the Connect Four we all grew up playing. Milton Bradly was eventually bought out by Hasbro who continues to sell the game.

## **HOW TO PLAY:**

<br />

- This is a two player game. Player 1 being the color **Red** and Player 2 being the color **Blue**. The board begins empty, and red is up first!

- The players will each take turns clicking on the column in which they want to drop their piece into the next available vertical slot in that column.

<br />

- Take turns until either **Red** or **Blue** has connected 4 pieces either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. The player that connects 4 first, wins!

<br />

- If the board fills up with neither player connecting 4, the game is a tie!
